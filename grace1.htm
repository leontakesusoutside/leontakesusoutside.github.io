<PRE>     The limbs and their components were then hung upon the splayed web,
       slug-like prey of some unimaginable creature.  The torso, by means
  of its bottom-most orifice, had been placed on a small support fastened
   to a marble base.  It was shown to varying degrees of success
    depending upon where one stood from behind the web
     but in front of the Museum door itself,
      acting as both signifier and guardian to the act.
