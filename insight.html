</TD><TD COLSTART="2" WIDTH="400">One of our main considerations was that we would walk into the 
studio unprepared but of a couple of skinny maxims and good shoes 
creating a workshop-in-progress situation.  We booked time in 
Mountain Studios in Montreaux, Switzerland with engineer David 
Richards, who was our engineer for the last album on which we 
worked together, Lodger, in 1979. <IMG SRC="bio6.gif" ALIGN="right"> As for musicians, it was important 
to choose those who were not weighed down with musical cliche, who 
had terrific control over their abilities yet were a bit loony.  My short list came down to Mike Garson, lovable, cuddly ex-
Scientologist pianist who provided the text book angular solo on the 
track "Aladdin Sane," from the album of the same name.  On bass and 
various keyboards, I fished around in Paris for Erdal Kizilcay, the 
only musician I know who, while at music college in Istanbul, was 
required to play every instrument in the orchestra to a solo 
proficiency.  Erdal worked with me through much of the middle to 
late eighties, and had just completed The Buddha of Suburbia with 
me.

For guitar, I opted for Reeves Gabrels, still for me one of the great 
unknowns of rock.  A man of huge inventiveness and perversity, he 
really made an admirer of me when, in a 1989 concert with Tin 
Machine, he executed an extraordinary solo with a fender guitar and 
a 9" stainless steel dildo.  Sterling Campbell, now with Soul
<IMG SRC="bio9.gif" ALIGN="left"> 
Asylum, had played drums for me on Black Tie, White Noise, and sort of 
"tranced" in for this set.   A bit of a walking mushroom, Sterling casts 
a major spell over any room he walks in and is a pure child-like 
spirit, adding incandescence to all he plays.  In our New York 
sessions we picked up Carlos Alomar, my old friend and rhythm 
guitarist, who has worked with me since 1974.

Having decorated the Mountain room with crazed color pieces of 
fabric brought from London by Brian, I equipped it with paints, 
charcoal, scissors, paper and canvas to give us something to flyaway 
on when not playing.<IMG SRC="bio10.gif" ALIGN="right">I also brought in my computer complete with a 
new program developed by an acquaintance that had the ability to 
randomize my writing line by line, three-word block by three-word 
block, and deliver up totally different composites of image and 
description from that which I programmed in.  A sort of electronic 
Bill Burroughs "cut--ups" machine.  It did in seconds what since 1973 
I had been doing with scissors and glue. 
The first major session was on the 12th of March, 1994.  Brian set up 
his various gizmos, rhythm machines, toy pianos, clocks, samplers, 
radio, etc., and gave each musician a flash card.  On it he had written 
a brief character description. "You are the last remaining survivor of 
a catastrophic event and you will endeavor to play in such a way as 
to prevent feelings of loneliness developing within yourself," or "You 
are a disgruntled ex-member of a South African rock band.  Play the 
notes they won't allow." I've made these up, but you get the idea.  
Our musicians were then enjoined to play within the parameters of 
these roles as much as was humanly possible.

My card informed me that I was a soothsayer and town-crier 
bringing stories and news to a society where information networks 
had broken down.  We started playing around twelve noon and 
didn't stop for three hours, new ideas and new rhythms being 
thrown in every few minutes by Brian or another of the band.  I had 
a table in front of me covered with regular lyrics and randomized 
pieces from which I would improv either in song or in dialogue both 
as narrator and character.

<b>Out of this first day came the bedrock of what was to be Adler's 
Diaries.</b>  Nathan Adler, Ramona A. Stone and Algeria Touchshriek 
came almost fully formed from these sessions, the other characters 
developing over the next few days.

..These include Leon Blank, a young man of mixed race, who is 
implicated in a series of hideous murders of doubtful aesthetic value.  
The first suspected victim is quite possibly Baby Grace Blue, a 
fourteen-year-old runaway.  However, the only evidence of Grace's 
past existence is a brief and sad cassette message found shortly after 
the discovery of the corpse's grisly unidentifiable remains.  Ramona A. Stone, a survivor of the seventies, is a second suspect.  
Her bizarre history of activities equals her sartorial self.  <IMG SRC="bio8.gif" ALIGN="left">A one-time 
high-priestess of a Berlin-based suicide cult, then proprietress of a 
body-parts jewelry store in London, the nineties find her 
underground in Oxford Town, surrounded by her sycophantic 
coteries of miscreants and acolytes.  Algeria Touchshriek--owner of a 
small shop on the corner, behind the Museum of Modern Parts--the 
Fishman and the Minotaur flesh out, so to speak, this ever-growing 
cast of characters, who will parade their secrets and ambitions 
though this album, under the ever-suspicious scrutiny of Detective-
Professor Nathan Adler of the Art-Crime Squad.  The series or hyper 
cycle of musical drama will terminate in 1999.  It will be collectively 
known as "The Nathan Adler Diaries."
