Welcome to David Bowie's <b>Outside</b> web site.  Here you can explore a dazzling, 
disturbing world of art, music, and murder, created by one of music's 
true visionaries.  <b>Outside</b> is Bowie's debut album on Virgin Records, due 
for release September 26.  The album and this web site are based on a non-linear 
gothic short story, "The Nathan Adler Diaries," written by Bowie.  Explore the
mysteries of this site and you will find music clips, stunning graphics, 
and the full text of the story, plus concert information, biographical
information, and reviews. Throughout the North American tour this site will be 
developing and changing -- check back to find special events, new concert photos, 
insight from Bowie, and much more.
