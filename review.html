<h5>With his new album, OUTSIDE, DAVID BOWIE returns to the 
scene of his greatest artistic triumph: the three albums 
which he made with Brian Eno in the late seventies - Low, 
Heroes and Lodger. OUTSIDE is BOWIE’s most ambitious record 
in fifteen years: the soundtrack for a diary not yet 
completed, for a film that you can replay in your own head. 
Each of the 14 songs can be heard individually, or as part 
of a multi-time, multi-viewpoint plot that veers from 1977 
to the very last day of the 20th century. Just as the 
present always contains the past and the future, so OUTSIDE 
captures our current uneasiness in a format that is part 
narrative, part examination of moods and feelings. 
<p>OUTSIDE is about what it is to be an outsider; not only 
where and how outsiders live, but how the fact of being an 
outsider makes them feel. As befits the multiphrenic nature 
of outsider art and emotions, BOWIE sings in any number of 
voices: one minute the melodramatic crooner, another the 
stylized Londoner, another the quiet, intimate recluse of 
his Berlin years. Or he is varispeeded between the album’s 
seven characters: on one song a 14-year-old girl, on another 
a sleazy 78-year-old, on another a 46-year-old Tyrannical 
Futurist. It is only now, when he has reached his own mid 
life, that BOWIE can make music that can encompass the point 
of young, middle-aged, and old. 
<p>OUTSIDE is a record that, in summarizing elements from 
BOWIE’s many glory periods, allows him to move forward into 
something completely new. The music matches BOWIE’s dazzling 
vocal/conceptual dexterity, with each collaborator providing 
elements of funk, rock, ambient techno, jungle and jazz-- 
all within the discipline of the pop song format. Although 
each of the 14 songs is different, they all form a complete 
whole: seamlessly segued, with Eno’s subliminal techno-
babble, into a coherent 75-minute presentation -- BOWIE’s 
state-of-the-art travelogue through out public and private 
emotional confusions, at the run up to the new millennium. 
What you hear in OUTSIDE is turmoil; fear; a sense of time 
collapsing as the past thousand years whirl around our 
heads. As he sings at the record’s climax: "It’s the angel-
man; I’m, deranged!" Yet there is something comforting in 
confronting the future: it makes you think that a future - 
however disturbing - is still possible. 
<p>DAVID BOWIE has 
always worked within the future. On songs like "Hallo 
Spaceboy," he returns to the scene of his pivotal success: 
the androgynous, science fiction spaciness of his first hit, 
1969’s "Space Oddity." In 1980, BOWIE made his first return 
to this theme with the answer song, "Ashes  To Ashes," by 
which time he had accomplished over ten years of consistent 
innovation, encompassing at least four different pop 
cultural futures -- the high-glam look of Ziggy Stardust, the 
soul boy funk of Young Americans, the ambient soundscapes on 
Low and Heroes. Somewhere during all this, DAVID BOWIE 
invented the pop video. 
<p>Long venerated in England and Europe, it has taken BOWIE 
until now to reach his fullest influence in America. 
Nirvana’s cover of "Man Who Sold The World" is forever with 
us on Kurt Cobain’s last record. BOWIE has been cited as an 
inspiration by many others among the Nirvana generation: 
Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots and Nine Inch Nails, 
whose Trent Reznor will be collaborating with BOWIE during 
the next year. 
<p>1996 will also see the release of the 
Basquiat film (subtitled, "Build A Fort, Set It On Fire") in 
which BOWIE plays the character he immortalized in his 1972 
song, "Andy Warhol." His co-stars are Gary Oldman, 
Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper; his director, 
America’s pre-eminent painter, Julian Schnabel. 
OUTSIDE takes the best of BOWIE and places him again at the 
forefront of popular culture, doing what he does best, 
singing and writing himself into the future.</h5> <p><br><br>Jon Savage<br>
