this fall with special guest NINE INCH NAILS in a meeting of two  of rock's most
acclaimed and visionary  performers.
<IMG SRC="conc2.gif" ALIGN="left">The much-rumored
<STRONG>Outside 
</STRONG> tour launched September 14 in Hartford, CT and features sets by both 
artists in addition to a surprise opening act. The trek - set to last for six
weeks in North America - will visit mostly  outdoor amphitheaters and have a
ticket price of $28.50 There will be  reserved seating at each concert, with all
of the shows having a general admission section in the pit.<p><IMG
SRC="conc3.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><p>For DAVID BOWIE, who is
headlining the tour,  this will mark his first solo concert tour since the 1990
&quot;Sound and Vision&quot; trek.  It also represents BOWIE&quot;s first tour
with new solo material in eight years,  coinciding with the September 26 release
of his Virgin Records debut album, OUTSIDE.  <P>The album reunites BOWIE with 
producer and collaborator Brian Eno for the first  time since the pivotal '70s
releases, Low, Heroes and Lodger, a trilogy of  experimental works that
established a blueprint for an array of industrial and  other contemporary
artists.

<IMG SRC="conc4.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><p>Highlights of <STRONG>Outside</STRONG> include &quot;The Hearts
Filthy Lesson&quot;-  a special version of which has been remixed by TRENT
REZNOR - &quot;Hallo Spaceboy,&quot;  &quot;We Prick You,&quot; &quot;I'm
Deranged&quot; and &quot;Voyeur Of Utter Destruction (As Beauty).&quot;</P><p>Set to perform onstage in
a stripped down, non-theatrical format, BOWIE  will be joined by a group of
musicians who've played with him at various points  in his career - guitarist
Carlos  Alomar (who has worked with BOWIE since 1974),  guitarist Reeves Gabrels
(Tin Machine), pianist Mike Garson  (Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane), background
vocalist George Simms (BOWIE'S 1983 tour)  --plus ex-Gang of Four bassist Gail
Ann Dorsey, synthesist Peter Schwartz and  drummer Zachary Alford.<P>Opening
for DAVID BOWIE will afford NINE INCH NAILS yet another opportunity to 
captivate a new audience.</P><P>Besides the unique pairing of REZNOR and BOWIE,
whose  album Low influenced TRENT during the recording of The Downward Spiral,
NIN's live  show alone promises to unite and turn on two generations of fans.
TRENT REZNOR and  his live band - Chris Venna (drums), Charlie Clouser
(keyboards), Robin Finck (guitar)  and Danny Lohner (guitar and bass) - eagerly
prepare to seduce this hybrid audience  by sharing the stage with DAVID BOWIE.
