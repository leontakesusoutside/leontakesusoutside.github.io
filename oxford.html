<P></P><I>To be sung by Leon Blank</I><P>
Baby Grace is the victim<BR> She was
14 years of age<BR> And the wheels are turning, turning<BR> For the finger
points at me<BR> All's well<BR> But I have not been to Oxford Town<BR> All's
well<BR> But I have not been to Oxford Town<BR>
<BR> Toll the bell<BR> Pay the private eye<BR> All's well<BR> 20th century
dies<BR><BR> And the prison priests are decent<BR> My attorney seems sincere<BR>
  I fear my days are numbered<BR> Lord get me out of here<BR> All's well<BR>
But I have not been to Oxford Town<BR> All's well<BR> But I have not been to
Oxford Town<br><br>Toll the bell<BR> Pay the private eye<BR> 
All's well<BR> 20th century dies<BR>
<BR> This is your shadow on my wall<BR> This is my flesh and blood<BR> This
is what I could've been<BR>
<BR> And the wheels are turning and<BR>  turning<BR> As the 20th century dies
<BR><BR> If I had not ripped the fabric<BR> If time had not stood still<BR>
If I had not met Ramona<BR> If I'd only paid my bill<BR> All's well<BR> 
<BR>But I have not been to Oxford Town<BR>
All's well<BR> But I have not been to Oxford Town<BR>
<BR> Toll the bell<BR> Pay the private eye<BR> All's well<BR> 20th century
dies<BR> And the wheels are turning and <BR> turning<BR> As the 20th century
dies<BR> This is my bunk with two sheets<BR> This is my food though foul<BR>
This is what I could have been<BR>
<BR> Toll the bell<BR> Pay the private eye<BR> All's well<BR> 20th century
dies
